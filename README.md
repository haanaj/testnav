# testnav
This is to test the navigation of Jekyll sites. To see any changes in code, go to the _includes folder and then click on header.html. 
I found [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13266369/how-to-change-the-default-order-pages-in-jekyll) and [this tutorial](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/simple-navigation/) particularly helpful.
